		WELCOME <br><br><br>
		The <b>Digital Library</b> provides free, <b>high-quality educational</b> resources for anyone, anywhere.<br><br>
		Digital libraries provide you with online access to a wide range of resources. They are often used by students for research or by <b>professionals seeking</b> to stay current on the latest developments in their field.<br><br>

Digital libraries can provide you with access to rare and out-of-<b>print materials</b> that might be difficult or impossible to locate in physical libraries. Digital libraries also offer a variety of search and sorting features, as well as social media-like features that can connect users with others to discuss topics.<br><br>
